Exercises
10.2-1
Explain why the dynamic-set operation INSERT on a singly linked list
can be implemented in O(1) time, but the worst-case time for DELETE
is Θ(n).
10.2-2
Implement a stack using a singly linked list. The operations PUSH and
POP should still take O(1) time. Do you need to add any attributes to
the list?
10.2-3
Implement a queue using a singly linked list. The operations
ENQUEUE and DEQUEUE should still take O(1) time. Do you need
to add any attributes to the list?
10.2-4
The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S1 and S2 as
input, and it returns a set S = S1 ⋃ S2 consisting of all the elements of
S1 and S2. The sets S1 and S2 are usually destroyed by the operation.
Show how to support UNION in O(1) time using a suitable list data
structure.
10.2-5
Give a Θ(n)-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked
list of n elements. The procedure should use no more than constant
storage beyond that needed for the list itself.
★ 10.2-6
Explain how to implement doubly linked lists using only one pointer
value x.np per item instead of the usual two (next and prev). Assume
that all pointer values can be interpreted as k-bit integers, and define
x.np = x.next XOR x.prev, the k-bit “exclusive-or” of x.next and x.prev.
The value NIL is represented by 0. Be sure to describe what information
you need to access the head of the list. Show how to implement the
SEARCH, INSERT, and DELETE operations on such a list. Also show
how to reverse such a list in O(1) time.
